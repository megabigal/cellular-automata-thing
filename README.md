a little tool i have made that lets you mess around with various different cellular automata
currently contains most elementary 2d automata that i found interesting enought to implement,


**Implemented Rules**  
Conway's Game of Life B3/S23  
Seeds B2/S  
Day And Night B3,6,7,8/S3,4,6,7,8  
Life Without Death B3/S0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8   
Brian's Brain B2/S (3-state)  
Ulam-Warburton B1/S0,1,2,3,4 (Neumann)  
Mazectric B3/S1,2,3,4  
Iceballs B2,5,6,7,8/S5,6,7,8    
Star Wars B2/S3,4,5 (4-state)  
Greenberg-Hastings B>0/S (3-state, Neumann)  
Biham–Middleton–Levine Traffic Model  
Nagel–Schreckenberg Traffic Model  
Wireworld  
Diffusion-Limited-Aggregation  

**Todo List**  
1d automata (wolfram)  
cyclic ones because they look crazy  
more tools to mess around with  
resizing  
ideally some way to copy paste some presets of structures and stuff (mainly for conways)
