a little tool i have made that lets you mess around with various different cellular automat
currently contains most elementary 2d automata that i found interesting enought to implement,

todo list:
1d automata (wolfram)
cyclic ones because they look crazy
more tools to mess around with, resizing, ideally some way to copy paste some presets of structures and stuff(mainly for conways)
